# Last Hope 3D Engine
In this repository you will be able to find a newly-created 3D game engine. 

It's been created for educational purposes, as we are 2 students from the Videogames development and design degree at CITM, Terrassa UPC.

# FEATURES
- You can load a 3D model (FBX) + Texture dragging and dropping it to the engine's window.
- The Properties window displays all the relevant information from the 3D model and its texture. 
- The Console window diplays all the relevant information comming from the inside of the engine. All kind of Logs, possible errors or usefull data. 
- The Application window displays all the relevant information from the engine's modules. It also allows to modify certain data to create a more personal engine. 
- You can freely orbit around your model with our 3D Camera. Controls: 
  * Right-Click free object orbit.
  * Right-Click + WASD moves the camera to the desider direction.
  * Mouse Wheel zooms in/out. 
  * ALT + Right-Click zoms in/out depending on the mouse motion. 
  * ALT + Left-Click focuses and orbits the 3D model on the X axis. 
  * F focuses the 3D model. 
 - Some of the main engine's information is stored in a configuration (JSON) file, so it is not lost in further executions.
